## Spam Classifier

A simple and effective spam message classifier built using the **Naive Bayes algorithm**. The model achieves **97% accuracy** and a **precision score of 1**, ensuring highly reliable detection of spam messages. The project also includes a user-friendly **Streamlit web app** for live predictions.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to detect spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It includes:
- Data Cleaning and EDA 
- Data preprocessing and vectorization
- Training with the Naive Bayes algorithm
- Evaluation using accuracy and precision scores
- A deployed interactive Streamlit app for real-time spam detection

## Model Performance

| Metric     | Score  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | 97%    |
| Precision  | 1.0    |

> The precision score of 1 means **zero false positives**, making this model especially reliable in not marking non-spam (ham) messages incorrectly.

## Streamlit App

The project is deployed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Users can input a message and instantly check whether it is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

To run locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
